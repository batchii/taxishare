RideOut README

As of the day of the submission on April 30th, our app still has a few kinks to be worked out before the final deadline.

Our most obvious issue is back end issues with Parse. Despite a thorough read through of the documentation and the logic of our queries, we were not able to get our data to successfully store to the online database. Unfortunately, this issue impacts our entire app's performance, as almost everything other that the UI is dependent on populated data from the database. So we opted, for the sake of the presentation, to hard code some data into the app to show the class our desired functionality of the app.

Another feature that is currently missing in the app is within the Ride Detail activity. The activity contains a list view with all logistical details about the ride in question except for the list of riders and a button to join or leave the ride. This, however, will be fixed as soon as possible.

We also acknowledge that our aesthetics are not up to par and this will be fixed before the final submission.

As soon as these issues are resolved, we predict that the remaining development of the app will be smooth sailing.

Our submission includes a functional user interface, fragments, and use of the Google Maps API complete with location auto-complete.
